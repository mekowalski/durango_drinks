1. I want to be able to not just list items, like all the bars, but drill into a bar a level deeper.

  How is a user going to communicate that they want a detail of a bar?
  How will I find that particular bar?
  How will I return them to the main menu?


2. I want to be able to index/show cafes and breweries in addition to bars.
